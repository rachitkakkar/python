# python
A major consolidation of various python scripts I have written. Each folder is a seperate has its own `README`, which describes the project in further detail. A blog post to explain all of my python projects is in the works!

**The projects in this repository were created over many years, spanning differing versions of python and having their own dependencies. As of such, their is no gurantee that these projects will still work as they did when they were initially created. However, an attempt has been made so that any included descriptions and output images (as well as just plain looking at the code) should give a good idea of what exactly each project was.**
